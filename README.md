GeoLedger brings radical transparency to philanthropy using Stellar blockchain. Donors see their money's journey on an interactive map and receive NFT proof of impact. We turn charitable giving from a leap of faith into a verifiable, tracked journey.
IDEA  : -
GeoLedger transforms charity with blockchain transparency. Every donation creates an NFT receipt and shows real impact on a live map. We make giving as trackable as a delivery, rebuilding trust in philanthropy.
Built on Stellar for near-zero fees and instant transactions, we ensure donations reach people, not middlemen. See your generosity travel and create verifiable change.
Our platform connects donors directly to projects they care about, with immutable proof of impact. No more wondering where your money went—watch it change lives in real-time.
By combining interactive maps with blockchain verification, we create the most transparent giving experience ever. Donors become partners in impact with permanent proof of their contribution.
GeoLedger isn't just another charity app—it's a movement for accountable philanthropy. We're using technology to ensure every dollar creates the change it promises.
